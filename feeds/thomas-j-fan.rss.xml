By definition, a customer churns when they unsubscribe or leave a service. With survival analysis, the customer churn event is analogous to death. Armed with the survival function, we will calculate what is the optimum monthly rate to maximize a customers lifetime value.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Thomas J.

The plan will fully take into affect at the end of 2017. We will analyze how NYC's current process to control rodent population is successful by using 311 complaint data and rodent inspection data.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Thomas J.

This can lead to size mismatches when constructing the neutral network. To remedy this issue, I created a small PyTorch UNet module that calculates the sizes for you. You can even customize the building blocks used to construct the UNet.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Thomas J.

One of those topics is Bayesian Statistics, the other is Statistical Power. In this post, I go through the analysis of flipping coins, and how to calculate statistical power for determining if a coin is biased or fair.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Thomas J.

To keep the climber safe, the climber wears a harness that is attached to to a rope. The rope is then wrapped around a pipe at least one time and then at least 160 degrees more depending on where your buddy is holding on to the other end. The amount of force needed to hold a climber up is surprisingly low because of how friction helps prevents the rope from slipping off the pipe.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Thomas J.

One of these facts is that the maximum of the damped oscillation solution is different from the envelope that is tangent to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Thomas J.

It magically complied all my files together and formed an executable. Now a days, I've moved on from using IDEs and switch to using a text editor, Sublime Text. As the C++ code I wrote started to get more complicated and span multiple files, I needed a way to systematically complied the files together. Thus, I created a Makefile to build and organize my C++ files...&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Thomas J.
