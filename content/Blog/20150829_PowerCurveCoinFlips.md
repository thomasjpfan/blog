Summary: There are a few topics that I wish were taught in an introduction to statistics undergraduate course. One of those topics is Bayesian Statistics, the other is Statistical Power. In this post, I go through the analysis of flipping coins, and how to calculate statistical power for determining if a coin is biased or fair.
