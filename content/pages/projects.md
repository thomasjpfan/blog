                <h3>Hassle Free UNet</h3>
                <span>github.com/thomasjpfan/pytorch_unet</span>
                <p>Constructing a UNet requires you to keep track of every signal size that flow through the UNet. This can lead to size mismatches when constructing the neutral network. To remedy this issue, I created a small PyTorch UNet module that calculates the sizes for you. You can even customize the building blocks used to construct the UNet.</p>
